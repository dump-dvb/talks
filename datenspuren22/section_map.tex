% For the map we need to know transmission locations.
% No locations in the telegrams, but "reporting points"

% Urbic site leaked quite some junction numbers
% sweatshop => json => first frontend up and running
% By hand doesn't scale, and OSINT is unrelaible source of the info => mapping

% record telegrams and positions => cross reference via time
% nice mobile box, gps tracker everyone has in their pocket nowadays

% run number is important!

% lofi! Several modes of operation.

% Process Now
%Low coverage => box plus phone
% nice stations => just GPS tracks

% Process in da future
% infer run number!
% just a track, with a nice web front

% Far future => infer as much as possible
